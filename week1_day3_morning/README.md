# [DATA](data)
The folder "_data_" contains the smaller data files for the morning session of day 3. However, we would advice you to use the data provided on SAGA as it will make the data transfer to your folder much faster.

# [SCRIPTS](scripts)
The folder "_scripts_" contains all the scripts to be run on SAGA. However, we would advice you that you transfer them from SAGA as described in the exercise below.

# EXERCISE
1. Download the data from the Github data directory, or use the .ufboot and .contree files you obtained from the IQTree analysis yesterday afternoon.
	
2. Navigate to the Roguenarok website at: https://rnr.h-its.org/about and click "submit job"
	
3. Upload your .ufboot file in the 'bootstrap file' space, and your .contree file in the 'maximum likelihood tree' space, and click submit.
		
4. Once the page has loaded, select "Strict Consensus" as your threshold to configure your rogue taxon search on the left of the screen. Then select optimise for support, and use the Roguenarok algorithm.ã€€Click 'Do it!' to start the analysis

5. Repeat the analysis twice, using "Strict Consensus" as your threshold and optimising for support, but once using Leaf Stability Index and once using Taxonomic Instability Index as your algorithms. How do the results compare? Are the same sequences selected as rogues each time? Why might that be?

6. Now we will comtinue with the analyses of rogue taxa using PhyUtility.

7. For getting started, copy all data from the folder "Day3Morning" to your folder in the project area in SAGA

	
	cd /cluster/projects/nn9458k/phylogenomics/$YOURNAME
	cp -r ../week1/Day3Morning .
	cd Day3Morning
	
	
8. For calculating the leaf stability indices using PhyUtility and the BAF for Argentina sp. run the following command

	
	sbatch sbatch_TreSpEx_Paralogy.sh
	
	
9. Let's take a look at the leaf stability indices. The lower the value the worse.
	
	
	tail -40 PhyUtility_results.Matrix_original_supermatrix.fas.ufboot_roo ted.txt > LeafStability_Indices_PhyUtility.txt
	sort -k2 -n LeafStability_Indices_PhyUtility.txt
	
	
10. Download "Matrix_original_supermatrix.fas.treefile_BAF_Argentina.tre" to your own computer using _scp_

11. Look at the tree file with FigTree:
	What alternative positions does Argentina have? What is the frequency?
