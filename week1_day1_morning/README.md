In the morning of day 1, we will have only lectures on how we get from sequence data to a first tree. As this is essentially covered by another courses on phylogenetic analyses, assembly and annotation, we will not do any practical exercises on this in this course. The lectures are just thought to get everybody on the page for our starting point.

The [tree of our starting dataset](https://github.com/ForBioPhylogenomics/tutorials/blob/f3d8f367a8c7d50a5a4b3f2a37e76a3574c831f2/week1_day1_morning/Matrix_Concatenated_Para_Conta_supermatrix.fas.treefile) and the corresponding [alignment](https://github.com/ForBioPhylogenomics/tutorials/blob/b61fcb3861930d533fac71dfe823a9fb2851f33a/week1_day1_morning/Matrix_Concatenated_Para_Conta_supermatrix.fas) are provided in here as well.

This morning we had the following lectures:
* [Introdution](Lecture/Day1_01_Introduction.pdf)
* [Sequence formats](Lecture/Day1_02_Sequence_formats.pdf)
* [Assembly](Lecture/Day1_03_Assembly.pdf)
* [Annotation](Lecture/Day1_04_Annotation.pdf)
* [Orthology](Lecture/Day1_05_Orthology.pdf)
